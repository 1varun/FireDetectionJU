# FireDetectionJU

This is my Final Year Project during my Under Graduation course at Jadavpur University.
The aim is to design an image processing based fire detection and suppression system.

## Introduction

The conventional fire detection methods are not perfect. 
Reporting fire from smoke of cigarettes, sprinkling water for all categories of fire are some of the drawbacks.
A possible solution can be fire detection and classification using image processing and further suppressing the fire by appropriate means as per the output of the algorithm.

### Scope of Work

```
a) PART 1:

Design an android app which can use the resources of phone (such as camera and
processor) to test the accuracy of the MATLAB Algorithm.
```
```
b) PART 2:

On successful completion of Step 1, implementing the same in a suitable microcontroller,
which could take in feed from a camera and run sprinkler system.
